Project Name: Ternary Tree
Author: Tyler Smith

Purpose: This program takes in user input of however many numbers they decide when running it.
	 The program then inserts each number individually into a ternary tree.
	 In the ternary tree, the numbers are stored from least to greatest.
	 After the numbers are inserted, it then prints out the numbers from least to greatest.
	 When printing, parenthesis are printed to show pareent and child nodes of the tree.

How it Works: The program sorts and puts the numbers into a ternary tree. The tree is made of Nodes.
              Each Node consists of two data values and three pointers to child Nodes.
              When created each Node only has one value, but when inserting new numbers the Node will be filled.
